                <p>What is Vercel and what does it do (2-5 sentence introduction)?</p>
                <p>Hi Clara,</p>
                <p>Iâ€™m excited that Acme University has purchased Vercel and that we will get to work together to implement it for the marketing department. Vercel is a platform for web developers that helps them build, deploy, and scale web applications. It is a fast and reliable tool for getting websites up and running and available for the public to view on the internet. It also has built-in features like analytics to help you better understand the performance of your website.</p>
                <p>Please see the following resources to better understand what Vercel is and what it can do:</p>
